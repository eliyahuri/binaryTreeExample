A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Key Concepts

- **Node**: The basic unit of a binary tree containing a value and pointers to its children.
- **Root**: The topmost node of the tree.
- **Leaf**: A node with no children.
- **Subtree**: A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.

## Types of Binary Trees

- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
- **Balanced Binary Tree**: The height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

## Common Operations

- **Insertion**: Adding a node to the tree.
- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the tree.
- **Traversal**: Visiting all the nodes in a specific order (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).

## Example

Here is a simple example of a binary tree:

```
  1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```

In this example:

- `1` is the root.
- `2` and `3` are children of `1`.
- `4` and `5` are children of `2`.

## Applications

- Binary trees are used in various applications such as expression parsing, searching algorithms, and hierarchical data representation.
